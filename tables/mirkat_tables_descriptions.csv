Table,Main Source,Primary Key,Key,Description
confidence_score,mirBase,-,-,evaluates the reliability of microRNA annotations based on experimental and structural evidence
dead_mirna,mirBase,-,-,annotation indicating microRNA entries that are no longer considered valid or active in the database
literature_references,mirBase,-,-,pertain to the primary research articles and associated PubMed IDs (PMIDs) that document the discovery and experimental validation of microRNA (miRNA) entries
mature_database_links,mirBase,-,-," cross-references connecting mature microRNAs (miRNAs) to external biological databases, enabling comprehensive annotation and functional analysis."
mature_database_url,mirBase,-,-,refers to the web-based access point for retrieving information about mature microRNA sequences
mirna,mirBase,auto_mirna,-,The mirna in their initial state. (the full sequence is here)
mirna_2_prefam,mirBase,"auto_mirna, auto_prefam",-,"maps individual microRNAs to their precursor families, which group evolutionarily related miRNA genes based on sequence/structure similarities."
mirna_chromosome_build,mirBase,-,auto_mirna,refers to the genome assembly version used to map microRNA (miRNA) genomic coordinates. This ensures accurate chromosomal localization and cross-referencing with other genomic annotations
